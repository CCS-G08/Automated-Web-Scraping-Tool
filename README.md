VULNERABILITY SCANNER DASHBOARD
===============================

📌 ABOUT
--------
This is a web-based Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard built with Flask, Python, and Bootstrap. It automates the process of crawling predefined URLs, scanning for vulnerabilities, categorizing their severity, and displaying results in a clean web UI. The system also allows notifying high severity vulnerabilities via email using the Gmail API.

✨ FEATURES
----------
- Web UI with Dashboard (Flask + Bootstrap)
- URL Crawler and Vulnerability Scraper (Selenium/Python)
- Parses and classifies severity as:
    - Numeric (CVSS score ≥ 7.0 → High)
    - Categorical (e.g., "Severity: High" or "Severity: Critical")
- Displays:
    - All scanned links
    - High severity links only
- Sends an HTML email notification for high severity vulnerabilities using Gmail API (OAuth2)

⚙️ USAGE
--------
1. Clone this repository and install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Set up Gmail API:
- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Enable Gmail API and create OAuth2 credentials (OAuth Client ID)
- Download `credentials.json` and place it in the project root

3. Run the app:
   python app.py

4. Access the web dashboard:
   http://localhost:5000

5. Use:
- Click "Run Web Crawler" to gather links
- Click "Run Scraper" to find vulnerabilities
- View high severity vulnerabilities
- Click "Notify via Email" to send alert email

📬 GMAIL EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS
----------------------------
- Email subject: "Vulnerability Alert 🚨"
- Body: A formatted HTML table of only high severity vulnerabilities
- Automatically reads from output.txt and filters relevant entries

✅ DEPENDENCIES
---------------
- Flask
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Gmail API (google-api-python-client, google-auth)
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)

📌 NOTES
--------
- Ensure `output.txt` is generated by the scraper before viewing results
- Gmail account must allow API access via OAuth2 (Gmail API enabled)
- Token is saved to `token.pickle` after first auth

🛠️ TO-DO (OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS)
-------------------------------
- Add login/authentication for dashboard
- Export vulnerability data as CSV
- Support scheduling scans with CRON
- Improve keyword matching with NLP or ML
